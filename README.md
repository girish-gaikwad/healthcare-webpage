# Project Overview

This project uses machine learning models trained on a large sample and utilizes some open-source APIs.

## Getting Started

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the repository*:
    sh
    git clone https://github.com/girish-gaikwad/healthcare-webpage.git
    

2. *Frontend Setup*:
    - Navigate to the frontend folder:
        sh
        cd frontend
        
    - Run the frontend on localhost:3000:
        sh
        npm start
        

3. *Backend Setup*:
    - Navigate to the backend folder:
        sh
        cd backend
        
    - Run the backend on port 5001:
        sh
        npm start
        

4. *Environment Variables*:
    - Before running the commands, create a .env file in the backend folder with the following variables:
        env
        DATABASE_URL=<your-mongodb-atlas-url>
        GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
        YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your-youtube-api-key>
        SPOTIFY_API_KEY=<your-spotify-api-key>
        

Now, you can access the webpage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The system includes various modules such as emotion recognition and analysis, personalized therapy recommendations, chatbot-based counseling, virtual reality therapy, mental health prediction, virtual peer support groups, personalized mood tracking, cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress management, and mental health chatbot for employees.

The codebase is written in Python and uses popular ML and NLP libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, NLTK, and SpaCy. The repository also includes pre-trained models, datasets, and scripts for training and testing the models.
